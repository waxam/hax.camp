<h3>Why is the camp called HAX?</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents">Web components</a>


, which the name is a valid one, are a way of scaling efforts by hacking traditional HTML and web development. Their ability to stack like reusable lego pieces, is the realization of the promise of a modular, reusable, and sustainable web. Working across libraries, they hack traditional ways of doing front-end application development. And thus, we will all be HAX'ing how we used to work.</p>
<p>The founders of this event work on a project called <a href="https://haxtheweb.org/" target="_blank" data-mce-href="https://haxtheweb.org">HAXTheWeb</a>


; short for Headless Authoring eXperience, which is built on top of hundreds of web components. By extending the web via web components, we'll extend the capabilities of HAX and so this event is dedicated to a mix of web components and HAX specific discussions.</p>
<p>This site is built using <i>HAXcms</i>

 and the <i>HAXeditor</i>

 to edit content.</p>
