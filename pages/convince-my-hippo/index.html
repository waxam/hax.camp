<p>HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) is super important to getting funding to come to HAX camp. Here's some easy reasons they'll be thrilled to send you:</p>
<ul><li>Web components can be used in any Content Management System (CMS) or Front End library you use currently!</li>

<li>Web components augment existing workflows, helping your team to work smarter, not harder, by building reusable, cross project components</li>
<li>Eventually, web components CAN replicate your front end stack, but only if you want them to.</li>
<li>Web components are a standard, they are only going to improve and increase in adoption (less framework retraining / churn).</li>
<li>Experts from some of the largest web component libraries will be there.</li>
<li>Web components reduce costs, improve transparency, are highly accessible, and generally just make web development fun again (and you want happy employees don't you!?)</li>
</ul>
