<p>HiPPO (Highest Paid Person's Opinion) is super important to getting funding to come to HAX camp. Here's some easy reasons they'll be thrilled to send you:</p>
<ul><li>Web components can be used in any Content Management System (CMS) or front end library you use currently!</li>


<li>Web components augment existing workflows, helping your team to work smarter, not harder, by building reusable, cross project components</li>

<li>Eventually, web components CAN replace your front end stack, but only if you want to and fit small and large scope projects.</li>

<li>Web components are a W3C browser standard, they are only going to improve and increase in adoption (less framework retraining / churn).</li>

<li>Experts from some of the largest web component libraries will be there. Learn from those forging the trail.</li>

<li>Web components reduce costs, improve transparency, are highly accessible, and generally just make web development fun (and you want happy employees don't you!?)</li>

</ul>
