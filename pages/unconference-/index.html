<p>If you've never been, they are awesome. here's a basic definition from Wikipedia.</p>
<wikipedia-query show-title="show-title" search="Unconference" render-as="content" style="width: 100%;" search-response="[object Object]"></wikipedia-query>
<p>Effectively, the people who show up form the schedule and go from there. HAX camp is not a pure Unconference as there are <b><i>some</i>
 </b>
planned session items but it is largely up to the group in attendance as to what direction it goes.</p>
<p>If 2 people showed up wanting to talk about how StencilJS elements data binding works in React? Then that'd be enough to have a conversation and call a session. If everyone wanted to learn about the Theming layer in HAXcms, that'd be on the schedule.</p>
<p>The only requirements of the Unconference are..</p>
<ul><li>Be respectful, but vote with your feet. If a conversation is not the one you wanted, find one you do. Participants are empowered to form the optimal conversations to make the most of the day for them.</li>

<li>Keep on point. If a session was called about a topic, try and stick to it unless the group wants to wander to other topics.</li>
<li>It must be related to <i>Web components</i>
 in some fashion.</li>
</ul>

<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We will then have 10 minutes for people to build the schedule by filling out large poster cards. After which time everyone who wishes to call a session gives an elevator pitch for it.</span></li>
<li><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We will then take 10 minutes and build the schedule on the wall.</span></li>
<li>We have now created a conference and the day commences</li>
</ul>
