, whether you are using HAXeditor/HAXcms or not.</p>
<p>Why is the camp called HAX?</p>
<p>The founders of this event think HAX is cool and it's a cool name and many of them work on a project called HAXTheWeb; short for Headless Authoring eXperience which is built out of hundreds of web components. By extending the web via web components, we'll extend the capabilities of HAX and so this event is dedicated to a mix of web components and HAX specific discussions.</p>
